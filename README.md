# PassLok-GenDir

This repo contains the files running the PassLok General Directory. They are not included in the regular PassLok repo because some versions are made directly from the repo using Phonegap, and the General Directory files should not be included in those.

The files are identical to those actually running the General Directory at https://passlok.com/lockdir, except that, obviously, the database names and passwords have been redacted.
